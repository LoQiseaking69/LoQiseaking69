        "The primary goal is to build a robust and efficient system capable of processing inputs through an SNN layer, followed by a transformer layer, and ultimately making decisions through a machine learning model embedded in the robot's core system. The project has undergone several phases of optimization, including the implementation of data augmentation techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and dynamic feedback loops.\n",

        "3. **Transformer Layer**: This layer further processes the data, leveraging the transformer's capabilities in handling sequential data.\n",
        "4. **Robot Core System**: The central system where data culminates, and decisions are made based on the processed inputs.\n",
        "5. **Main Script**: A script that integrates all the components and facilitates the smooth flow of data through the system.\n"
