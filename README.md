I'm navigating through the complexity of artificial intelligence and Robotics, stemming from my Data Science Studies at `Bloom Tech` where i'm learning 
to break down ideas pulled straight from the chest to whatever end... effector; probably🥁

— a trajectory of curated ambitions. Whether these concepts resonate with you or spark curiosity, they represent a meticulous journey through the iterations of my work.

## Projects and Collaborations 
- Keen to synergize on transformative models and diverse network architectures.

anyone with exerience modeling supervised and reinforcement learning models for polynomial distributions or multimodel systems, I welcome the assistance toward improving this [dataGen notebook](https://github.com/LoQiseaking69/SephsBIOME/blob/master/Docs/Model/Tests/Utils/notebooks/SephsStarter.ipynb) and this [Model](https://github.com/LoQiseaking69/SephsBIOME/blob/master/Docs/Model/Versions/SephModelV5_(1).ipynb) to be their best selves 🧐🤭
