- 👋 Hi, I’m @LoQiseaking69

Welcome to my scratch board! If you can peak through the jumble,
possibly curated in repo files on this page, i'm working on a few of those details...

You might not find interest or might; nevertheless, the compartmentalized concepts in succeeding
versions of the built upon ambitions held therein, are selectively derived and progressed along 
a trajectory... from the chest.
so guess and have fun.
- 👀 I’m interested in A.N.N's, AGI (multimodal networks as i see it) and quantum shite.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use jupyter-notebooks for data science.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various transformer models
   and other network architectures.
- 📫 How to reach me ... 8bakfjqmj2@privaterelay.appleid.com
